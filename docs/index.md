## Workshop Overview

This workshop is designed to help participants understand how to scale log analytics using Dynatrace, particularly leveraging its Grail-powered Log Management and Analytics capabilities. Itâ€™s hands-on and intended for technical users who want to explore log ingestion, querying, and visualization at enterprise scale.

**Lab tasks:**

1. About

    - Understand the purpose of this workshop and what will be accomplished

2. Getting Started

    - Complete prerequisites before starting the workshop

3. Codespaces

    - Deploy Kubernetes cluster with demo applications used during the workshop
    - Deploy Dynatrace configurations (such as workshop notebooks) using Monaco

4. Deploy Dynatrace

    - Deploy Dynatrace on Kubernetes for full-stack observability with logs in context
    - Validate observability signals, including logs

5. Scaling Log Analytics

    - Learn the best practices of scaling log analytics with Dynatrace
    - Reference presentation companion asset

6. Configure Dynatrace

    - Configure Dynatrace using the best practices covered in scaling log analytics

7. DQL Exercises

    - Learn how to use Dynatrace Query Language (DQL) to perform fast and powerful analytics on your observability data, including logs

8. Anomaly Detection

    - Leverage Dynatrace's Davis AI to detect anomalies from log data to identify issues and resolve them faster

9. Dashboards

    - Learn how to visualize observability signals, including logs, using the powerful and easy to use dashboards in Dynatrace
